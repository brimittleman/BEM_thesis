# Data

This subdirectory contains the Tables provided as supplemental files.

## Chapter 2

Chapter 2 has 2 tables total and they are all supplemental. 

## Chapter 3

Chapter 3 has 4 tables total, and they are all supplemental. 


## Combining into zip file

I have to upload the files manually to the online submission system,
so I zipped them all into one file.

```
cd data
mkdir dissertation-blischak-tables
cp table-* dissertation-blischak-tables
zip -r dissertation-blischak-tables.zip dissertation-blischak-tables
rm -r dissertation-blischak-tables
```
